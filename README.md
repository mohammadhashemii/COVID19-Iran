#This project was the computational Intelligence course assignment-1

In this project, we had to use the COVID-19 statistical dataset which has been released by [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_Iran). So the dataset is available in `COVID19_IRAN.csv`

The goal of this assignment is to try both linear and polynomial regression in order to predict the number of deaths and also infectiones of the corona virus cases in Iran since 2020. Detail information and other explanation of them are documented in `covid19_iran_analysis.ipynb`.
